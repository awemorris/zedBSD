# PC-98 DOS Linux loader

`linux98.exe` loads an uncompressed ELF32/i386 `VMLINUX` through DOS file
I/O, copies every `PT_LOAD` segment to its ELF physical address, builds Linux
`boot_params`, then switches to 32-bit protected mode and enters `e_entry`.

It calls PC-98 BIOS INT 1Bh SENSE for every visible IDE and SCSI fixed disk
and passes one `SETUP_PC98_DISK` record per drive to Linux.  Records are keyed
by the raw BIOS drive ID (80h-83h for IDE and A0h-A7h for SCSI), and the drive
selected for boot is marked separately.  This lets Linux decode each NEC98
partition table with that disk's BIOS logical heads/sectors, including values
installed by DOS geometry-extension utilities.

The repository tracks a prebuilt `linux98.exe`; normal image builds copy that
binary and do not require OpenWatcom. Maintainers can rebuild it with
OpenWatcom 1.9 from the repository root:

```sh
./build.sh dos-loader
```

## zedBSD disk installer

`INST.EXE` is intentionally limited to three installation operations. It
expects `IPL-LBA0.IMG`, `IPL-LBA2.IMG`, `IPL-PART.IMG`, and `IO.SYS` beside
the executable:

```dos
INST /LBA0
INST /LBA2
INST /PART C:
```

The first two commands operate on the physical IDE disk containing the
current DOS drive. `/PART` accepts an explicit DOS drive, copies `IO.SYS` as
a normal hidden/system/read-only FAT16 file, verifies that its FAT chain is
contiguous, and writes the 1024-byte partition PBR while preserving the BPB.
The target must already be a FAT16 partition named `BOOT`, with one 1024-byte
reserved logical sector and identical IPL/data-start CHS values. `INST.EXE`
does not create a partition table, format FAT, copy `vmunix` or `VMLINUX`,
or erase the future root partition. Every raw PBR sector is read back after
writing.

The reserved 1024 bytes and `IO.SYS` are separate objects. The reserved
logical sector is outside the FAT cluster area. No prefix of `IO.SYS` is
copied there; every byte of `IO.SYS` remains in its ordinary FAT cluster
chain. The contiguity requirement is the traditional DOS system-file rule.

Generated BOOT partitions contain the complete reusable installer kit in
their `INST` directory: `INST.EXE`, `IO.SYS`, `IPL-LBA0.IMG`, `IPL-LBA2.IMG`,
and `IPL-PART.IMG`. The root also retains the active boot copy of `IO.SYS`.
The PBR is deliberately kept as `IPL-PART.IMG`, rather
than embedded in `INST.EXE`, so it can be inspected, replaced, and installed
by non-DOS tooling.

Run from the `INST` directory under plain real-mode DOS:

```dos
LINUX98.EXE ..\VMLINUX ide0 root=PARTLABEL=LINUXROOT rw
LINUX98.EXE ..\VMLINUX scsi0 root=/dev/sda2 rw
```

The drive argument accepts `ide0` through `ide3` (BIOS IDs 80h through 83h)
and `scsi0` through `scsi7` (BIOS IDs A0h through A7h). A bare digit `0`
through `3` remains an alias for the corresponding IDE unit. If it is
omitted, the loader uses BIOS work-area byte `0000:0584`. The selected device
must respond to SENSE; absent units encountered while enumerating the remaining
IDE and SCSI namespaces are skipped. All successful logical H/S results are
passed unchanged to Linux. The initial version does not support EMM386, QEMM,
a Windows DOS box, initrd, or compressed kernel images. HIMEM.SYS may be loaded
only if it does not virtualize protected mode; testing first without memory
managers is recommended.
